- Random Number Generator (RNG):
This project implements a simple Random Number Generator (RNG) in Python, capable of generating random numbers from uniform, 1D Gaussian, and 2D Gaussian distributions, along with visualizations.

- Installation:
To run the code, make sure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn

- How to Run:
-- Import the RNG class in your Python script or notebook.
-- Use the methods provided to generate random numbers from different distributions.
-- Call the visualization functions to see the distributions of the generated numbers.

- Error Handling:
The RNG class includes error handling for:

-- Positive counts for generated numbers.
-- Non-negative standard deviation values.
-- Matching dimensions for the mean vector and covariance matrix.

- Conclusion:
This RNG provides a straightforward way to generate and visualize random numbers.
